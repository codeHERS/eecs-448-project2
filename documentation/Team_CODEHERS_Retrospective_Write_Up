How was work split?

The project we recieved was working well and was split into useful classes, so we did not need to add any additional classes.
For our contribution to this project, we added an AI, a Storm feature, and Sound effects. We split the work as fair as we could taking
in consideration that we had one team memeber who left for a conference for a week, and another team member who was sick at the start of
the project. Anjali and Sindhu worked mainly on the AI functionality. Sindhu worked on the Medium AI, and Anjali did the Easy and Hard AI.
Victoria added some "graphics" to the terminal with realtion to the AI following the other team's style. Anjali worked on sound features,
she added all the sounds that are activated with different actions in the game. Victoria worked mainly on the Storm feature functionality.
We also all gave ideas, approved sounds, and helped each other with things realted to git and segfaults.
